INSTALLING THE PBC_BCE LIBRARY
==============================

First install the PBC library:

    http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/

The PBC library needs the GMP library:

    http://www.swox.com/gmp/

To compile:

    gcc testbce.c bce.c -lgmp -lpbc

You may need to add -L or -I flags depending on where GMP and PBC are
installed.
